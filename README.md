# album_3x3
A website to display a 3x3 grid of album covers


# To-Do List:

- Have small sound preview when you hover over the album.
- Have text appear from the album when you hover over it, talking about the album.
- Add CSS-JS dropdown that allows user to change 3x3 to up to 6x6.
- Allow user to add their own albums (obviously)
